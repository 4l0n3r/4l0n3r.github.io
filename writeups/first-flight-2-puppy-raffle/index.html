However, the longer the <code>PuppyRaffle:players</code> array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas costs for players who enter right when the raffle starts will be dramatically lower than those who enter later. Every additional address in the <code>players</code> array is an additional check the loop will have to make.<pre class=language-solidity data-lang=solidity style=color:#61676c;background-color:#fafafa><code class=language-solidity data-lang=solidity><span>// Check for duplicates
