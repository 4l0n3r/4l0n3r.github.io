# 🧱 Solidity Projects

When I started learning web3 stuff, I started with cyfrin courses. Below are the collection of smart contracts and decentralized applications I’ve built using Solidity and the Foundry framework. I have added the github links for all the projects. It might help the ones who are starting to learn solidity & foundry framework.

## [fund-me](https://github.com/4l0n3r/fund-me)
A beginner-friendly smart contract where users can contribute ETH, featuring owner withdrawal logic and Chainlink price feeds.

A decentralized lottery system using Chainlink VRF to select random winners fairly.

## [foundry-dao-cu](https://github.com/4l0n3r/foundry-dao-cu)
A refined DAO version focused on custom governance and unit testing coverage in Foundry.

## [foundry-upgradable-contract](https://github.com/4l0n3r/foundry-upgradable-contract)
A project demonstrating how to create upgradable smart contracts using the proxy pattern in Foundry.

## [defi-stablecoin](https://github.com/4l0n3r/defi-stablecoin)
A minimal DeFi stablecoin system with CDP (collateralized debt position) mechanisms and liquidation logic.

## [merkle-airdrop](https://github.com/4l0n3r/merkle-airdrop)
