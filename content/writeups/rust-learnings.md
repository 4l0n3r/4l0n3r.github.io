# Introduction
Iâ€™ve been diving into Rust â€” a systems programming language known for its memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and powerful concurrency support. The below repositories track my progress and understanding.

## ðŸ“˜ [Rustic Journal](https://github.com/4l0n3r/rustic-journal)

This repo serves as my **personal learning journal** while reading the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). It contains code snippets, examples, and written reflections to help internalize key Rust concepts.

Covered so far:

- Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes
- Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching
- Modules and Crate structure
- Error handling (`Result`, `Option`)
- Collections (`Vec`, `HashMap`)

This is an ongoing repository where I log practical experiments, deeper dives, and Rust ecosystem notes.

## ðŸ¦€ [Rustlings Exercises](https://github.com/4l0n3r/rustlings-exercises)

This repository contains my solutions to the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises â€” a tool designed to help learners practice Rust syntax and patterns via small, interactive tasks.

Each completed exercise demonstrates:

- Syntax familiarity
- Understanding of ownership, references, and memory management
- Use of traits, generics, and control flow

It's a hands-on way to reinforce concepts from the Rust Book and solidify muscle memory with the compiler.
