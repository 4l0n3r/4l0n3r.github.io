This project implements a **Merkle Tree** in Rust ‚Äî a fundamental data structure widely used in blockchain, cryptographic proofs, and distributed systems.

It demonstrates how Rust's powerful standard library, ownership system, and strong typing make it well-suited for secure and efficient data processing.

### üîç Features

- SHA-256 hash-based Merkle Tree implementation
- Recursive tree construction from leaves
- Verification of Merkle proofs (hash paths)
- Utility functions to build, traverse, and verify Merkle roots
- Simple CLI (optional) or main file for running test examples

---

### üß† Learning Outcomes

This project helped deepen my understanding of:

- Binary tree structures and recursion
- Rust‚Äôs slice and vector handling (`Vec<u8>`, slices, lifetimes)
- SHA-256 hashing with the `sha2` crate
- Real-world blockchain primitives (used in Ethereum, Bitcoin, ZKPs)

---

### üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Rust**
- **sha2 crate** for hashing

---

This project serves as a building block for more advanced blockchain topics like Merkle proofs, zk-SNARKs, and rollup state validation. Check out the code on GitHub to see it in action!
